# Civic Auth Integration for Healthcare Applications

## Overview

Integrating Civic Auth into healthcare applications provides a secure, user-controlled identity solution built on blockchain technology. This guide explains how to make the most of Civic Auth features in healthcare contexts.

## Key Benefits

1. **Self-Sovereign Identity**
   - Patients own and control their healthcare identity
   - No centralized identity database vulnerable to breaches
   - Users decide what data to share and with whom

2. **Compliance-Ready**
   - HIPAA-friendly authentication architecture
   - Audit trails on blockchain for regulatory compliance
   - Reduced liability through decentralized identity management

3. **Enhanced Security**
   - Multi-factor authentication built in
   - Biometric verification options
   - Blockchain-verified credentials

4. **Embedded Wallet Functionality**
   - Enable Web3 features with minimal friction
   - Support for healthcare-related tokens and credentials
   - Potential for tokenized health rewards and incentives

## Integration Steps

1. **Register as a Civic Developer**
   - Visit [Civic Developer Portal](https://www.civic.com/developers/)
   - Create a new application
   - Obtain your App ID

2. **Configure Your Environment**
   - Add your Civic App ID to your `.env` file:
     ```
     VITE_CIVIC_APP_ID=your_civic_app_id_here
     ```

3. **Setup Callback Handling**
   - Ensure your application has a `/auth/callback` route
   - Implement proper session management after authentication

4. **Customize Civic Auth Options**
   - Apply healthcare-specific theme settings
   - Enable appropriate authentication methods
   - Configure KYC verification level based on your needs

## Healthcare-Specific Implementations

### Patient Identity Verification

```typescript
// Request additional verification for prescription access
const verifyForPrescriptions = async (userId: string) => {
  if (!civicAuth) {
    throw new Error('Civic Auth not initialized');
  }
  
  return await civicAuth.requestVerification({
    userId,
    level: 'advanced',
    purpose: 'prescription-access',
    requiredAttestations: ['kyc-aml', 'healthcare-id'],
  });
};
```

### Provider Credential Verification

```typescript
// Verify medical provider credentials
const verifyProviderCredentials = async (providerId: string) => {
  if (!civicAuth) {
    throw new Error('Civic Auth not initialized');
  }
  
  return await civicAuth.verifyCredential({
    type: 'MedicalLicense',
    issuer: 'verified-credentials',
    subject: providerId,
  });
};
```

### Consent Management

```typescript
// Record patient consent on blockchain
const recordConsent = async (patientId: string, providerId: string, purpose: string) => {
  if (!civicAuth) {
    throw new Error('Civic Auth not initialized');
  }
  
  const consentRecord = {
    patient: patientId,
    provider: providerId,
    purpose: purpose,
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    expiration: Date.now() + (90 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000), // 90 days
  };
  
  // Store consent hash on blockchain
  return await civicAuth.recordConsent(consentRecord);
};
```

## Advanced Features

### Embedded Wallet for Health Data

The embedded wallet feature allows patients to:
- Store tokenized health records
- Control access to their medical data
- Maintain a portable health identity across providers
- Participate in health-related blockchain applications

### Verifiable Credentials

Implement verifiable credentials for:
- Medical license verification
- Insurance verification
- Lab result attestations
- Vaccination records
- Prescription authorizations

### Health Data Sharing

Enable secure, patient-controlled sharing of:
- Medical history
- Current medications
- Allergies and conditions
- Treatment plans
- Lab results

## Best Practices

1. **Clear User Consent**
   - Always explain what data will be stored and accessed
   - Provide options to revoke access
   - Display data sharing status clearly

2. **Minimal Data Collection**
   - Only request the verification level needed
   - Store sensitive data off-chain when possible
   - Use zero-knowledge proofs for verification without data exposure

3. **Emergency Access**
   - Implement emergency override procedures
   - Consider trusted delegate access
   - Balance security with practical medical needs

4. **User Education**
   - Help users understand the benefits of blockchain identity
   - Provide clear guidance on wallet security
   - Explain the recovery process for lost credentials
